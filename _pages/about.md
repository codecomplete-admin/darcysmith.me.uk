Hi, I'm Darcy Smith and I have been a software developer for over 20 years. My experience primary targets the Microsoft stack but has diversified more in recent years. I have always taken a more traditional approach to employment and have taken on a full-time permanent basis. Until now! Eeeeeek! I have recently taken the decision to diversify my career and instead take shorter term contracts to help startups or well established software companies to further improve their architectures / processes / code bases.

## About this blog

I have always made good use of other developer blogs in my day jobs. I regularly find myself scouring the Internet in the evenings, trying to find out more about a specific technology or implementation pattern. It's about time I gave a little bit back to the "community".

It also coincides with my need to attract more attention from the IT industry and market my skills, experience and passion for software to a wider audience than just my immediate team. Hence, [darcysmith.me.uk](https://darcysmith.me.uk).
